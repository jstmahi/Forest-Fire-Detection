#  Forest Fire Detection Using MSA-Net with SE Blocks

This project presents a lightweight and efficient deep learning model for early forest fire detection. It integrates a Multi-Scale Attention Network (MSA-Net) with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to enhance feature extraction and focus on fire-relevant regions. The model is optimized for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices like drones and IoT systems.

## Features
- Achieved 96.1% test accuracy
- Real-time classification performance
- Lightweight architecture suitable for edge devices
- Robust against background noise and varied lighting conditions

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the Forest Fire, Smoke and Non-Fire Image Dataset from Kaggle.

### 🔽 How to Use

1. Visit the dataset page:  
👉 [Click here to download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amerzishminha/forest-fire-smoke-and-non-fire-image-dataset?resource=download)  

2. Download the ZIP file and place the extracted folders inside a `data/` directory within your project:

> Note: The dataset is **not included** in this repository due to its large size (~7GB).

## Trained Model

The trained model (`model.h5`, ~1.5GB) is not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limitations.
